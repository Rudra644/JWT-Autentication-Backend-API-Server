  <h1>Secure and Scalable Role-Based JWT Authentication API Server</h1>
  <p>This backend API server provides a robust and secure foundation for your application by implementing role-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).</p>

  <h2>Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Role-Based Authorization: Enforces access control based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.</li>
    <li>JWT Authentication: Utilizes JWT tokens for stateless authentication, offering flexibility and scalability for your API.</li>
    <li>Secure Configuration: Leverages environment variables (.env) to manage sensitive data securely.</li>
    <li>Mongoose Integration: Integrates with MongoDB for efficient and scalable data persistence (optional, based on your project's requirements).</li>
    <li>TypeScript Support: Enhances code maintainability and type safety, especially for larger projects.</li>
  </ul>
